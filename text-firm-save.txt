        <strong>LAURENCE P. GREENBERG, ESQ.</strong>
        Laurence P. Greenberg is a matrimonial powerhouse who was recently rated one of NYC's top ten divorce lawyers. He has handled numerous trials in his career, which spans over 20 years and has been devoted to representing clients in complex divorce cases.

Mr. Greenberg has keen interpersonal skills and unique ability to understand the nuances surrounding every client matter, each of which he recognizes as distinct and individual in nature.

Recently, Mr. Greenberg won two consecutive landmark cases in Manhattan whereby income of approximately $1 million per year was imputed to a husband who either failed to properly declare his true earnings or attempted to cheat his spouse out of millions.

Even though he considers the courthouse his second home, he makes every effort to settle cases out of court as long as he can achieve the best result for the client and the client's family.

Laurence is married and has two children currently in elementary school.
